# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a React site specifically forms, added dynamic form parts which can be added or removed by means of an add and remove button, conditional rendering based on a drop down and finally created my own form validation. Besides that I've setup a blog using Gatsby which is deploying automagicially with each commit using Netflify

**Thoughts:** On my daily job I work with VueJS and it was to figure out how forms work in React. :red_heart: how lightweight Gatsby is. Really feels like the tool for the job without to much overhead.
