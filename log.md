# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a React site specifically forms, added dynamic form parts which can be added or removed by means of an add and remove button, conditional rendering based on a drop down and finally created my own form validation. Besides that I've setup a blog using Gatsby which is deploying automagicially with each commit using Netflify

**Thoughts:** On my daily job I work with VueJS and it was interesting to figure out how forms work in React. :heart: how lightweight Gatsby is. Really feels like the right tool for the job(In this case blogging) without too much overhead.

### Day 1: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Implemented disqus on the site to be able to leave comments on blog posts, together with a comment counter. The other thing implemented is a syntax highlighter using prismjs

**Thoughts:** Looks like there are a lot of plugins tweaked for Gatsby. Can't wait to check out more! :metal:

### Day 2: August 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked again on the React site, turning the input of the form into a workable object. Also worked on implementing a tags system on the Gatsby blog

**Thoughts:** A lot of console logging to create the data structure I had in mind. Implementing the tags on Gatsby required more time than expected and will continue with that Tomorrow! :metal:

### Day 3: August 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finalized the implementation of the tagging system on my Gatsby blog and experimented with some styling options, just plain CSS and styled components. Obviously it needs some more styling, but that's for tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Really nice to have finalized the tagging system. For the styling I think I'll go with styled components. Just feels more natural in React. :metal:

### Day 4: August 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling of the tags in the blog post template. Chose styled components to do the job

**Thoughts:** Happy with the styling, thinking now I should have the complete tags list on the index page as well. Nice job for tomorrow! :metal:

### Day 5: August 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on solving an issue with the deployment to Netlify, Getting an error when running the build command

**Thoughts:** Not sure what the issue could be. Found one part of the issue some utils got lost with merging.

### Day 6: August 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with resolving the deployment issue on Netlify. Did some more debugging and research and found the issue. For work we use an older version of node, which caused an issue with building. Luckily I have NVM installed so switching versions was easy.

**Thoughts:** Very happy that it is already fixed :metal:. These kinds of issues can really cause a headache!
