# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a React site specifically forms, added dynamic form parts which can be added or removed by means of an add and remove button, conditional rendering based on a drop down and finally created my own form validation. Besides that I've setup a blog using Gatsby which is deploying automagicially with each commit using Netflify

**Thoughts:** On my daily job I work with VueJS and it was interesting to figure out how forms work in React. :heart: how lightweight Gatsby is. Really feels like the right tool for the job(In this case blogging) without too much overhead.

### Day 1: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Implemented disqus on the site to be able to leave comments on blog posts, together with a comment counter. The other thing implemented is a syntax highlighter using prismjs

**Thoughts:** Looks like there are a lot of plugins tweaked for Gatsby. Can't wait to check out more! :metal:

### Day 2: August 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked again on the React site, turning the input of the form into a workable object. Also worked on implementing a tags system on the Gatsby blog

**Thoughts:** A lot of console logging to create the data structure I had in mind. Implementing the tags on Gatsby required more time than expected and will continue with that Tomorrow! :metal:
